Your Bank Statement Converter now has a complete **admin approval system** for managing user registrations!

### 🎯 Key Features

   - Approve or reject users with one click
   - See statistics (pending count, total users)
   - View all users with their status

3. **Admin User Management**
   - Dedicated admin role with special privileges
   - First admin created via script
   - Only admins can access `/admin/dashboard`

## 📂 New Files Created

### Frontend:

  - `get_pending_users()` method
  - `approve_user(user_id)` method
  - `reject_user(user_id)` method

## 🧪 How to Test (Step by Step)

2. Go to **Register** page
3. Register a new user:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123
   - Confirm: test123
4. Click "Register" - should see "Registration successful! Wait for admin approval"

### 4. Test Pending User Cannot Login

2. Should see error: "Your account is pending admin approval. Please wait for approval before logging in."

### 5. Test Admin Approval Process

3. Should successfully log in and see converter interface

### 7. Test Admin Rejection
1. Login as admin again
2. Register another user: test2@example.com
3. In admin dashboard, click **✗ Reject** for test2@example.com
4. Confirm rejection
5. User is deleted permanently
6. test2@example.com cannot register again (will need new email)

### 8. Test Non-Admin Access Protection
1. Login as test@example.com (regular user)
2. Try to access http://127.0.0.1:5002/admin/dashboard
3. Should see error: "Admin access required" and redirect to home page
